# ContinuousTimePolicyGradients
ContinuousTimePolicyGradients.jl is a package
for development and implementation of continuous-time policy gradient (CTPG) methods.

## Notes
- This package is WIP; may include verbose tutorials for Julia, DifferentialEquations.jl, etc.
- The ownership of this package can be changed.
- Thanks to [Namhoon Cho](https://github.com/nhcho91) for the shared materials and the initial efforts to investigate CTPG methods.
